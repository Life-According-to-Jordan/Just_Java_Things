# Scala Resources 

I'll be working out of an online scala IDE for practice, find it [here](https://scalafiddle.io/)! This is convenient to work 
if you don't want to commit to downloading different files.

### Links 
All of these links come from the scala docs site:

1. [scala docs](https://docs.scala-lang.org/tour/tour-of-scala.html)
